A Python library wrapping many NLP tasks on a corpus

# Sailor NLP in a nutshell
> There are plenty of NLP libraries in Python, yet most of them (spaCy, NLTK, Textblob) are dedicated to single text analysis. <br>
> When you have to extract information from a corpus of texts or documents you always need to reinvent the wheel.<br>
> That's when the **Sailor** comes in ! To guide and help you explore unstructured text corpuses. <br>
> The goal is not create state-of-the-art NER or sentiment analysis model, but to wrap plenty of functionalities from topic extraction to supervised learning.<br>

## Use cases
Anything that has multiple texts:
- Set of reviews or comments
- Set of articles
- Set of tweets

## What can you except ?
- Unsupervised learning (Clustering)
- Unsupervised mining (Topic extraction)
- Supervised learning (Classification)
- Supervised mining (Interpretability, Universe extraction)
- Corpus modelling (Doc2Vec)
- Visualizations
